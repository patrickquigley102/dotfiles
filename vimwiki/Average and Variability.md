# Finding the Middle: Average and Variability

## Finding the Middle (the Average)

There are three primary techniques for calculating the Average.

1. Mean - Sum of all values divided by quantity.
2. Mode - Most frequent value
3. Median - The middle value

The mean is heavily affected by outliers. 
The median isn't.

I've never used the mode.

## Variability

Finding the middle is great but, what about how spread out the values are? Is
the mean useful or is there a huge variance that skews the mean?

Variability - How spread out (i.e. variable) a sample is.

There are many ways to measure variability. Here I'll cover two.

1. Range
2. Standard Deviation

### Range

The range is the largest value - the smallest value. It's a measure of
variability sure but, it focuses on the most EXTREME (parkour!) values.

### Standard Deviation

A measure of variance. The standard deviation is how far way from the mean the
average data point is!

A lower value indicates the sample has a low variability, the average value is
close to the mean.

The standard deviation relies on the mean so, it's just a susceptable to EXTREME
values!
