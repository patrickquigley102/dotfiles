# Basics

## Population and Sample

- Population: The whole group/entity you're trying to describe.
- Sample: A subset of the whole population.

All TF2 players are the Population of TF2 however, asking them all their
favourite milkshake would take forever and be toxic as hell. Where as, asking a
Sample of them would be easier and could possibly be representative of the
Population.

## Parameters and Statistics

- Parameter: Describes a unknown quantity of a Population.
- Statistic: Describes a known quantity of a Sample.

Population = Paramter, Sample = Statictic!

## Discrete and Continuous Data

- Discrete: Finite values (or buckets).
- Continuous: Infinite values along a continuum.

The number of hairs on my head is discrete yet the time taken to count them is
continuous.
